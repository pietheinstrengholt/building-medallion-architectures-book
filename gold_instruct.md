Gold layer
Delivers refined data optimized for specific business insights and decision making. The Gold layer involves aggregating, summarizing, and enriching data to support high-level reporting and analytics. This layer focuses on performance, usability, and scalability, providing fast access to key metrics and insights.
Its key characteristics are that it’s highly curated and optimized for consumption, so the data in the Gold layer supports strategic business operations and decisions.

## Star Schema
    - Star schemas will likely address most of your needs. They excel at conducting complex analyses on historical data and transforming data into entities such as an OLAP cube (a multidimensional data array based on online analytical processing). 
    
    - When you design star schemas, remember that their role extends beyond just boosting performance. They are shaped based on how users interact with data. Think of your data model as a public interface, similar to an API or a function. 
    
    - It’s essential to make this interface intuitive and logically structured, just like any tool designed for user interaction. This way, users can navigate and utilize the data more effectively.

    - In Kimball methodology, there are two key types of tables used to organize and manage data:
        - Fact table
            A fact table is the central table in a star schema. A fact table stores quantitative data for analysis and is designed to be compact, fast, and adaptable.
        - Dimension table
            Dimension tables are used to describe dimensions of the facts; they provide the context for the data. In essence, dimension tables store attributes related to the measurements in the fact tables, which helps in making the data understandable and readable.

    - Loading the star schema involves two primary tasks: loading the dimension tables and loading the fact tables. These steps are crucial for operationalizing the schema to support business analysis and decision-making processes. 
        - Loading the dimension tables
            Loading dimension tables in a star schema is complicated by the need to handle SCDs, an incremental process that involves comparing incoming data with the existing data in the dimension table.

            After harmonizing the records, they are ready for insertion into the dimension table. This process might involve several hops or stages. 
        - Loading the fact tables
            The primary task involves replacing the business keys, which describe business transactions, with surrogate keys linked to the dimension tables. Each row in the fact table includes foreign key references to rows in the dimension tables.

            It’s crucial to create the dimension tables before the fact tables because fact tables rely on dimension tables for their surrogate keys. Without the presence of business keys in the dimension tables, it becomes impossible to locate and assign the appropriate surrogate keys.

            early arriving fact. In such cases, the creation of placeholder records becomes necessary. These records represent the missing entries and help maintain the integrity of the relationships between the dimension and fact tables, ensuring the star schema functions correctly.
    - Optimizing loads
        When loading a star schema, various bottlenecks can occur, such as excessively long lookup times that force users to endure lengthy waits. To address this issue, you can optimize the data processing by incorporating administrative columns into your tables. For example, adding columns like type1_hash and type2_hash can streamline the detection of type 1 and type 2 changes during the ETL process.

        In a SCD1 model, you overwrite the old value with the new one, keeping no history. 
        The SCD2 model preserves both current and historical records within the same file or table.
    - Star Schema Design Nuances
        there is significant diversity in how different organizations manage their models. Let’s explore some alternative approaches to give you a broader perspective on the possibilities.
        - Curated, Semantic, and Platinum Layers
            For example, some organizations might add extra conformed or curation layers, with separate (semantic) layers for data marts that use star schemas. 
            
            Occasionally, these additional layers are called Platinum layers, highlighting their specialized and highly refined nature. 
            
            In such setups, it’s common for organizations to follow some type of enterprise data modeling, like creating standard reference tables and conformed dimensions, which can be used across multiple data marts within a larger lakehouse architecture. 
            
            Despite being considered complex and time-consuming, this approach remains popular because it ensures data reusability and standardization across different parts of the organization.
        
        - One-Big-Table Design
            OBT involves storing all relevant data for analysis or operations in a single, large table. This method avoids distributing data across multiple tables or organizing it according to more complex schemas, such as star or snowflake schemas.

            - Easier to manage
                OBT is often simpler to manage and understand, particularly for those who are not specialists in data warehousing. 
            - Better performance
                For certain types of queries, especially those that do not require aggregating large volumes of data from various dimensions, a single big table can offer better performance. The elimination of joins that would be necessary in a star schema can lead to faster query execution times.
            - Flexible schema
                A single big table provides a flexible schema that can be easier to modify and extend compared to a more rigid star schema. This can be particularly valuable in fast-paced environments where business requirements change frequently, necessitating quick adjustments to the data model.
            - Preferred by data scientists
                Designs featuring one large table can also be preferred by data scientists who work with tools that expect data in one flat format. These OBT designs also offer convenience
                when transforming data into vector or graph-based datasets for modeling.
            - Great for long-term analysis
                For datasets that inherently track changes over time (like sales or user activity data), a single, large table can make time-series analysis more straightforward. Analysts can observe historical trends and make future predictions based on a continuous stream of data.

## Serving Layer
    you might still find it necessary to replicate data across other types of databases, in addition to lakehouses, using Delta tables.

    Lakehouse architectures often employ a diverse mix of technology services to satisfy various needs effectively. 
        - A typical lakehouse architecture includes serverless compute for ad hoc querying, Spark for big data processing, and Delta tables where the bulk of the data is stored. 
        - Relational databases might be used for handling more complex queries, time-series databases that cater to the Internet of Things (IoT) and streaming analysis, and reporting cubes like Power BI for facilitating analytics and visualization. 

    The decision to complement the Gold layer with an additional layer using other database technologies often hinges on usability, compatibility with other services, flexibility, performance, and cost considerations.

## The Gold Layer in Practice
To achieve this, aligning closely with data governance is crucial to maintain compliance, integrity, and security. It’s important to document and catalog all datasets, maintain
transparency about how data is used, and segment data for specific use cases. Clearly defining roles and responsibilities within this framework also ensures accountability and adherence to best practices.
